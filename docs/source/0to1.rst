Upgrade from substance 0 to 1
============

Upgrading from substance 0 to 1 requires moving your dependencies from Python 2 to Python 3 and VirtualBox 6.0.

Upgrading on macOS
--------

#. Stop all your engines::

    $ substance engine ls
    $ substance engine halt <ENGINENAME> # Do this for every running engine

#. Uninstall substance::

    $ sudo pip uninstall substance

#. Upgrade VirtualBox to 6.x::

    - Visit https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
    - Install the package on your computer.
    - Your existing machines and engines should remain intact.

#. Upgrade Python to Python 3::

    $ brew uninstall python
    $ brew uninstall python@2
    $ brew install python

#. Install ``substance``::

    $ sudo pip3 install substance

#. Upgrade your engine by either creating a new engine.


Upgrading on Windows
--------

#. Stop all your engines::

    $ substance engine ls
    $ substance engine halt <ENGINENAME> # Do this for every running engine

#. Uninstall substance via cygwin::

    $ sudo pip uninstall substance

#. Upgrade VirtualBox to 6.x::

    - Visit https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
    - Install the package on your computer.
    - Your existing machines and engines should remain intact.


#. Upgrade Python to Python 3::

  - Run the Cygwin setup (setup-x86_64.exe)
  - Remove python, python-devel and python-pip
  - Add python3, python3-devel, python3-pip

#. Install ``substance`` using the Cygwin terminal::

    $ sudo pip3 install substance

Upgrading on Linux
--------

#. Update your system.::

    # Debian/Ubuntu
    $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

    # Arch
    $ sudo pacman -Syu

#. Reboot::

    - needed in case the virtualbox kernel modules were updated.

#. Stop all your engines::

    $ substance engine ls
    $ substance engine halt <ENGINENAME> # Do this for every running engine

#. Install python3::

    # Debian/Ubuntu
    $ sudo apt-get install -y python3.7 python3-pip

    # Arch
    $ sudo pacman -S python python-pip

#. Update substance::

    $ sudo pip3 install substance

#. You will need to create a new engine so that it can use the newest docker image and virtualbox version::

    $ substance engine create <ENGINENAME>

Post-Install steps
--------

#. After upgrading to substance 1.x, you should take a moment to update your jinja templates to use Python 3 syntax. ::

    # example:
    # dockwrkr.yml.jinja

      [...]

      VAR_NMAILER_REMOTE_USER: ""
      VAR_NMAILER_REMOTE_PASS: ""
      {%- for k, v in SUBENV_VARS.iteritems() %}

    # becomes

      VAR_NMAILER_REMOTE_PORT: "587"
      VAR_NMAILER_REMOTE_USER: ""
      VAR_NMAILER_REMOTE_PASS: ""
      {%- for k, v in SUBENV_VARS.items() %}

Known issues
--------

#. If you get a ``CryptographyDeprecationWarning`` when running substance commands, it's because of `this issue <https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/1369#>`_. As noted, a workaround is running ``sudo pip install cryptography==2.4.2`` until the problem is fixed in paramiko.
